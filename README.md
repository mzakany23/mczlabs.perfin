## Thoughts and next steps


I should be able to send files (name formatted) to s3 bucket
I should be able to run stack locally
I should be able to build a reference stack locally (docker?)
I should be able to parse rows based on a generic accounts.json lookup
I should be able to have an aggregation approach
I should be able to get data from a csv or plaid api
